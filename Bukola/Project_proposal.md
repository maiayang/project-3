Project Overview
The Recipe Data Exploration and Analysis project aim to leverage the Recipe Search API, enabling us to search through millions of web recipes. As a collaborative effort within the data engineering track, our focus will be on exploring and analyzing the vast dataset available through this API.

Objectives
Data Retrieval and Transformation: Utilize the Recipe Search API to retrieve a diverse set of recipe data, covering various cuisines, ingredients, and cooking methods.

ETL Workflows: Implement Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflows to ingest data from the API. The original dataset(s) will undergo transformations to ensure consistency and relevance to our analysis.

Database Integration: Utilize SQLite as the database technology to store and manage the transformed recipe data. The database will consist of at least two tables: Recipes and CO2 Emissions.

Collaborative Data Analysis: Collaborate with team members to perform data engineering processes and explore the recipe dataset. Analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to derive meaningful insights.

Project Phases
1. Data Retrieval and Ingestion
Develop Python scripts to interact with the Recipe Search API.
Retrieve a diverse set of recipes covering various cuisines, ingredients, and cooking methods.
Implement ETL workflows to clean and structure the raw data.
2. Database Setup
Create an SQLite database to store and manage the transformed recipe data.
Define the database schema with at least two tables: Recipes and CO2 Emissions.
Recipes Table: Stores information about various recipes.
CO2 Emissions Table: Stores data related to the carbon emissions associated with each recipe.
3. Collaborative Data Exploration
Collaboratively analyze the dataset to uncover patterns and trends within the data.
Emphasize data engineering aspects without the use of data visualization tools.
4. Documentation and Reporting
Document the ETL processes, database schema, and analysis methodologies.
Generate a comprehensive report summarizing key findings and insights.
Include diagrams or an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrating the database structure and relationships.

Expected Outcomes
A well-structured SQLite database containing cleaned and transformed recipe data.
Collaboratively developed Python scripts and workflows for future data exploration projects.
